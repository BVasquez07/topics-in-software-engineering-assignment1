# description of the problem that this application will solve
### This application will tackle the increasing problem of fake news/media used to incite hate/violence among the populace. This is a very huge and increasing problem as generative AI allows for faster more realistic deep fakes both in terms of text and image creation. [The rise of AI fake news is creating a ‘misinformation superspreader’ by the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/17/ai-fake-news-misinformation/)

### The primary users of this application are media resources such as online forums, bloggers, online reviewers, news stations. This is because these outlets are prone to biased, skewed, and at times false data to instigate a response among users in order to gain watch time or due to unreliable sources. Thus with this resource an added layer of cross refrencing will be added to the workflow for these outlets to ensure that they are providing the highest and most accurate information to the masses. The secondary user of this application would be the general population so that individuals themselves will be able to take it upon themselves to ensure that the information they are recieving is as accurate as possible.
